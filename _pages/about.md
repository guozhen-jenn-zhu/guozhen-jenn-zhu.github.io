Welcome! I'm the Principal Scientist of Origin Research in Rockville, MD, USA, working on wireless sensing with K. J. Ray Liu.

Before joining Origin Wireless AI, I earned an M.S. degree and a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the ECE Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA in 2022 and 2023, respectively. I received a B.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China in 2019.

My research interests include **wireless sensing**, **artificial intelligence**, **signal and image processing**, the **Internet of Things**, and **simultaneous indoor localization and mapping**. I like cool and artistic research works but believe in those solving real-world problems.

Discussions and collaborations are always welcomed!
