Principal Scientist @ Origin AI
I'm a Principal Scientist at Origin AI, where I lead cutting-edge research in context-aware AI systems and ambient intelligent sensing technologies, working closely with Dr. K. J. Ray Liu. I received my M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2022 and 2023.
My research aims to make intelligent systems more aware, adaptive, and trustworthy in the real world. I focus on enabling devices to sense, understand, and respond to human activity and environmental context in a contactless, scalable, and privacy-preserving way—empowering applications in smart homes, healthcare, security, and beyond.
My current interests include:
* Signal-driven Representation Learningfor interpretable, robust perception from real-world ambient data.
* Efficient and Trustworthy Edge AIfor real-time, low-power deployment on resource-constrained devices.
* Generalizable Intelligencetackling cross-user, cross-environment, and cross-device adaptation.
I like cool and artistic research works but believe in those solving real-world problems.

Outside of work, you’ll often find me on the tennis court, playing the piano, baking something semi-sweet, or soaking in nature’s beauty.
Thanks for stopping by! I’m always open to discussions, new ideas, and meaningful collaborations—don’t hesitate to reach out!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
